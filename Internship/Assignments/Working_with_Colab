* Create a new notebook

Head over to Colab [https://colab.research.google.com] and click on New Notebook (choose either Python 2 or 3) to create a new notebook.

By default it’s created in your Google Drive under Colab Notebooks. Since it’s in Google Drive,

you can move it around and share it just like any other Drive documents.

* Using a local notebook 

Upload the notebook file to folder 'Colab Notebooks', then open it from there in colab.
